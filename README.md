# üìã Release Versioning

Pantas follows a structured versioning approach to help you understand what's changed between releases.

## Modpack Version Numbers

Each release uses this pattern: **Minecraft Version** + **Modpack Version**

- **Major** `?.x.x` - Significant changes like new mod additions or removals
- **Minor** `x.?.x` - Configuration updates, setting adjustments, or smaller mod changes  
- **Patch** `x.x.?` - Mod updates with minimal impact, bug fixes, or maintenance

Example Version Format: `1.21.4-1.0.0`

## New Minecraft Versions

When Minecraft updates (like `1.21.4` ‚Üí `1.21.5`), the modpack version resets to `1.0.0` since mod compatibility often requires starting fresh.
